Okarito in the days leading up to the Milestone 3 test. Milestone 3 was an electrical systems test involving the robot's ability to detect objects in the arena such as walls and the beacon. To accomplish this we added a flashlight and light sensor. The light from the flashlight bounces off the retro-reflective tape on the beacon and can be picked up by the light sensor.

The state of the robot on the final day of testing. A fender and cable management system was added to prevent the string from tangling in the robot. Decorations were also added to help persuade the judges to choose us for the tournament. Overall the test was successful and Okarito received 50/50 marks.
