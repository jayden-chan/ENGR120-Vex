# ENGR120-Vex

RobotC source code for my team's ENGR 120 Vex robot, "Okarito". The robot's objective is to locate a beacon within a 2.3 by 2.3m area and attach a cable to it.

Okarito in the days leading up to the Milestone 3 test. Milestone 3 was an electrical systems test involving the robot's ability to detect objects in the arena such as walls and the beacon. To accomplish this we added a flashlight and light sensor. The light from the flashlight bounces off the retro-reflective tape on the beacon and can be picked up by the light sensor.
