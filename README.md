# ENGR120-Vex

RobotC source code for my team's ENGR 120 Vex robot, "Okarito". The robot's objective is to locate a beacon within a 2.3m by 2.3m area and attach a cable to it.

Okarito received 50/50 marks on its final Milestone test and went on to win the course-wide competition with an average connection time of 5.87 seconds.
